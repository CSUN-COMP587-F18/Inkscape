To understand inkscape, I have read every bit of documentation within the code.
I have also been reading any readable code on github because reading different formats without the proper software is frustrating and tedious.
This has allowed me to understand its functionality better.
I've also played with it to understand its functions better.
Ironically reading the code makes it easier than playing with it, though there are a lot of visual aids within the comments.
Within the code there are things that I need to learn and be familiar with namely SVG and jemalloc and its purpose.
I most likely need to look up how to create fuzzers to test the SVG code for exception in image creation( there is one in the code).
I've found what parts I need to be testing to align with my proposal, but the problem is finding them again is a problem.
